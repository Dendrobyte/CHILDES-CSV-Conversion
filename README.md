# CHILDES-CSV-Conversion
A "small" script I wrote that converts CHILDES data into a spreadsheet format given certain forms of context.

## Information

This was written for a project I had for my First Language Acquisition class at NYU during the Spring 2021 semester. Professor is Ailis Cournane. My research project investigates child uses of "or" and whether children use "or" as an exclusive or ("xor") or and inclusive or ("ior"). I'll push my research paper to [my website](http://www.markobacon.com) when it's completed if you're curious.

## How It Works

The script is meant to be just that, and thus works in the shell, I didn't bother with UI or anything. The data will ask for a link to the `.cha` file on the [CHILDES database](https://sla.talkbank.org/TBB/childes/) and then prompt you for the search terms you intend to search of. A few more things that I intend to outline in this README once I finish the code, of course, and you'll end up with a CSV file with your data! You can also append data on to an existing spreadsheet if you'd like to compile data from multiple files.
